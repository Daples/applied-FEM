# Applied Finite Elements (WI4205) - Spring 2023

This repository contains the code developed for the three code assigments of this
course. The first is an implementation of the FEM in 1D, the second is verification and
validation of it, as well as the adaptation for a mixed problem. The last one is the
implementation in 2D.

Some of the functions were provided by the lecturer. If this is the case, it is
specified in the method docstring.
